# Elefridge.jl
*How to put an elephant into a fridge?
Size: You may buy a very large fridge, but that’s a very large fridge.
Precision: You may store a picture, but then you don’t know how it looks from behind.
Speed: You may store its DNA, but then it takes years to recreate an elephant.*

This is a work-in-progress repository on fast and precise but lossy data compression for climate data. 
This repository is inteded for the work on [ECMWF](https://www.ecmwf.int)'s [summer of weather code](https://esowc.ecmwf.int) [challege #14: Size, precision, speed - pick two](https://github.com/esowc/challenges_2020/issues/4).

## Proposal
